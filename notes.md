## Feature Brainfart


### Connect Spotify

Connect spotify as part of this app.
Study Spotify's API and see how a chrome extension can handle it.

### Dampen Audio

Designate the main soundtrack (Youtube, Spotify). When user plays another video (i.e. Youtube tutorial),
the main audio is dampened to the user-chosen sound level. Provides users a constant stream of music
while allowing it to switch to BGM mode when necessary.

- What if the secondary video (i.e. tutorial) already has BGM?
