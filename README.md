# CafeTube
## Description
CafeTube is the chrome extension that will give you an endless flow of audio from the YouTube videos handpicked by yourself!

Ever open multiple YouTube video tabs at once, only to have five different videos playing at the same time, causing a cacaphony of untracked sound? Yeah, I hate that too. CafeTube fixes that problem by pausing all other video tabs when a YouTube video is played form a tab. When you pause the playing video, the most recently played video resumes, giving a constant flow of sound!

For me, worked best when I had a video tutorial on one tab, a music video on another: when you need to pause the video tutorial to take notes / code, music seamlessly plays from the other tab!

## Installation
1. Download the `.zip` file and unpackage it
2. On your Chrome Browser, go to [chrome://extension]
3. Turn on **Developer Mode** on the top right corner
4. Select **Load Unpacked**
5. Select the _unzipped_ **CafeTube** folder

Enjoy!
