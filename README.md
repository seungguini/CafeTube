# CafeTube
## Description
YouTube lets the user maintain a in-site playlist to control the order of playback.
But why should the user be constrained to a single tab? Many of us open multiple tabs
with different YouTube videos to watch later, only to leave them untracked and unorganized.

CafeTube is a chrome extension that controls the playback of YouTube videos, providing users with background music that adapts to their unique working environment.
Its two key features are:
- playback control across multiple browser tabs (and winodws)
- audio fill which allows the user to constantly have a stream of audio
