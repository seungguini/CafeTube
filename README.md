# YouTube Tab Switch
## Description
YouTube Tab Switch is _the_ chrome extension that maintains one, and _only_ one video playback, no matter how many video tabs are open. _Pausing_ a video plays the **second-most recently played video**, and vice versa.

## Analogy

Imagine a _switch_. As a switch is binary and exclusive, it can either be set to one, or the other. Never both, never neither. **ON** or **OFF**.

YouTube Tab Switch maintains this analogy by always having one, and _only_ one video playing. Pausing a video automatically triggers another video to play, having one constant, uninterrupted flow of video.

## Motivation

As many do, my tabs were always a _convoluted_ mess of multiple websites and YouTube videos. Several videos would play at the same time, creating a cacaphony of untracked sound.

I needed a way to maintain a single flow of video, so I created this extension! 

For me, I utilize the extension by opening a video tutorial on one tab, a music video on another: when you need to pause the video tutorial to take notes / code, music automatically plays from the other tab!

## Need to temporarily disable app?
Simply turn the app off through the popup _switch_!

## Installation
1. Download the `.zip` file and unpackage it
2. Make sure all YouTube tabs are closed first!
3. On your Chrome Browser, go to <chrome://extension>
4. Turn on **Developer Mode** on the top right corner
5. Select **Load Unpacked**
6. Select the _unzipped_ **YouTube Tab Switch** folder
