# YouTube Tab Switch
## Description
YouTube Tab Switch is _the_ chrome extension that will give you elevated control of YouTube video playback across multiple tabs and windows!

Ever open several YouTube video tabs at once, only to have five different videos playing at the same time, causing a cacaphony of untracked sound? Ever wish your music video automatically played in the background when you pause your tutorial to take notes? YouTube Tab Switch solves this problem simply and efficiently:

When a user plays a video, videos on all other tabs and windows pause, giving you instant focus. When you pause the video you are watching, the preceding most-recent video plays, giving you a seamless flow of video (or audio)!

Even works _across_ windows!

For me, works best when I have a video tutorial on one tab, a music video on another: when you need to pause the video tutorial to take notes / code, music seamlessly plays from the other tab!

If you ever miss the old playback properties, simple disable the app with the popup button!

## Installation
1. Download the `.zip` file and unpackage it
2. Make sure all YouTube tabs are closed first!
3. On your Chrome Browser, go to <chrome://extension>
4. Turn on **Developer Mode** on the top right corner
5. Select **Load Unpacked**
6. Select the _unzipped_ **YouTube Tab Switch** folder


Enjoy!
